# bittrex-interface

A simple interface to Bittrex.com cryptocurrency exchange with a few other functions (in process of development).
Not intended for public use, I made it just to improve my coding skills before moving on to larger project.

Main features:
A list of all coins available at Bittrex with images, info and current prices for manual selection.

Semi-auto mode: automated placement of buy/sell orders on selected coins, stop loss execution.

Full auto mode: do nothing while price rises, sell on price drop. 

There was an auto buying mode, too, but I never implemented any serious technical analysis of the price and I doubt that technical analysis is of any use at all, especially on falling markets. That's why I decided to pay more attention to fundamental analysis instead, and let this thing be just a helper tool for good old manual trading. There are also three more features: crypto portfolio, mining calculator and a list of promising coins, all in one database and currently in development.
